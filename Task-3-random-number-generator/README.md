# Random Number Generator API

This project demonstrates how to create a serverless function using AWS Lambda to generate random numbers and trigger it through API Gateway.

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply deploy the serverless function to AWS Lambda and configure API Gateway.

## Usage

To use the API, send a GET request to the endpoint provided by API Gateway. Each request will trigger the Lambda function to generate a new random number between 1 and 100.
